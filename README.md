Hey there! 🌟

Welcome to the cool side of my world – the spot where I spill the beans on my adventures in software testing. 🕵️‍♂️💻

So, who am I? I'm Latha H J, your go-to Software Test Engineer, rocking the testing scene for about 2.5 years. I've dived deep into the realms of manual testing, covering all bases from Gaming to Media and Entertainment. 🎮🎬 With a knack for picking out the tiniest glitches to ensuring users get nothing but smooth sailing experiences, I've handled it all - functional, regression, you name it!

Here's a sneak peek into my toolbox 🧰:
- **Testing Mastery**: From making sure apps work like a charm (Functional, UAT, you get the drift) to keeping bugs in check, I've got it all up my sleeve.
- **Tech Toolkit**: JIRA, Confluence, and a whole lot more. If it's about organizing and tracking our testing quests, I'm on it.
- **Platform Prowess**: Whether it's web, mobile, or desktop, I've tested 'em all.
- **Strategy & Execution**: Crafting the game plan (test plans, cases) and jumping into action to ensure everything ticks just right.
- **Bug Detective**: Spotting and reporting those pesky bugs is my forte, making sure nothing slips through.

Let's talk projects 🚀:
- **A23 RUMMY**: Got to play the testing maestro for this leading online rummy platform. Ensured the game's as engaging as it gets, balancing functionality, UI/UX, and performance. Bagged the Extra Mile Champ title for my knack at uncovering unique issues.
- **A23 FANTASY & GAMES**: Dived into a world of online games, ensuring top-notch performance and seamless user experiences across the board.
- **CRICKET.COM**: Made sure fantasy sports enthusiasts get the best experience, tracking issues like a pro and earning kudos as the Extra Mile Champ early in my career.

**Evolving & Learning**: I'm all about upping my game - jumped into automation testing, became buddies with API testing, and turned Google Sheets into my playground.

**Team Player Vibes**: From daily huddles and virtual meet-ups via Google Meet to keeping everyone on the same page with JIRA and Confluence, I'm all about that team spirit. 💪
